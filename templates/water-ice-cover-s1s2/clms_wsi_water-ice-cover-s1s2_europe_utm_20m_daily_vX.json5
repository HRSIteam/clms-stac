It results from the combination of WIC S1 and WIC S2 which are respectively water and ice cover data based on synthetic aperture radar data from the Sentinel-1 constellation and on optical satellite data from the Sentinel-2 constellation. The product provides the river and lake area covered by snow-covered or snow-free ice with a spatial resolution of 20 m x 20 m.",
